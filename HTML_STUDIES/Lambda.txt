I just descovered a way to frame a function so that it takes an argument
and print the positive and negative values.
the values are going to be the same and just different in the signed
they carry.

I was studying Lambda functions in python and mage this serendipitious
discovery.

this is what happened on the thursday, 4th day of April 2023 at (09:30 am
- 09:55 am)
below is the lamda function:
y = lambda x: 7*x - 5*x
y = lambda x: 3*x - 5*x
I tested the following values (-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12)
