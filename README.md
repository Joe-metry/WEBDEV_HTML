A brief overview of what HTML is:
---------------------------------

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a standard markup language
used for creating web pages and other online documents.
It provides a set of tags and attributes that define the
structure and content of a web page, such as headings, paragraphs,
images, links, and forms.

HTML code is interpreted by web browsers, which use it to render
web pages and display them to users. The code is made up of
elements that are enclosed within angle brackets and typically
consist of a start tag, content, and an end tag. For example, the
following HTML code creates a simple paragraph:

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

=================================================================

HTML can also be used in conjunction with other technologies,
such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, to create
more dynamic and interactive web pages.
